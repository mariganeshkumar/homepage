EEG signals and task-independent person-specific signatures	Ph.D. Seminar I	Research Talk 	Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Department of Computer Science and Engineering	2019-04-23	Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India		"Recent studies have shown interest in using brain signals collected through electroencephalography (EEG) as a reliable biometric. However, owing to limited data, the focus of the field has been limited to classical techniques using different elicitation protocols. The primary interest for studying different elicitation protocols is that individuals will have a distinctive signature for a given task which can be leveraged to identify them. We conjecture that the biometric signatures should be present in the EEG signal irrespective of tasks or state of the brain.

Both speech and brain signals are temporal data which can be described as a sequence of observations â€” the analysis of these signals to get the required information has always been a challenging task. In this talk, we draw parallels between the problem of biometric recognition using speech and brain signals. For decades, owing to the enormous amount of data available, a lot of machine learning and statistical techniques have been proposed to extract biometric information from a speech signal irrespective of the spoken content. Using the universal background model - Gaussian mixture model (UBM-GMM), a text-independent speaker verification technique, we first verify the conjecture that biometric signatures should be present in the EEG signal independent of task. Later, we extend and modify the current state-of-art subspace-based speaker verification techniques to identify individuals from EEG signals irrespective of the task reliably."
Subspace techniques for task independent EEG person identification	Research Scholars' Symposium	Research Talk at WiSSAP 2019	WiSSAP 2019	2019-01-29	Trivandrum, Kerala, India 		There has been a growing interest in studying electroencephalography signals (EEG) as a possible biometric. The brain signals captured by EEG are rich and carry information related to the individual, tasks being performed, mental state, and other channel/measurement noise due to session variability and artifacts. To effectively extract person-specific signatures present in EEG, it is necessary to define a subspace that enhances the biometric information and suppresses other nuisance factors. i-vector and x-vector are state-of-art subspace techniques used in speaker recognition. In this paper, novel modifications are proposed for both frameworks to project person-specific signatures from multi-channel EEG into a subspace. The modified i-vector and x-vector systems outperform baseline i-vector and x-vector systems with an absolute improvement of 10.5% and 15.9%, respectively
