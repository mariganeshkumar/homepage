    abstract={While existing methods rely on data-driven methods and the physiology of neurons for modelling the spiking process, this work exploits the nature of the fluorescence responses to spikes using signal processing. We first motivate the problem by a novel analysis of the high-resolution property of minimum-phase group delay (GD) functions for multi-pole resonators. The resonators could be connected either in series or in parallel. The (Ca2+) indicator responds to a spike with a sudden rise, that is followed by an exponential decay. We interpret the (Ca2+) signal as the response of an impulse train to the change in (Ca2+) concentration, where the (Ca2+) response corresponds to a resonator. We perform minimum-phase group delay-based filtering of the (Ca2+) signal for resolving spike locations. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated on nine datasets spanning various indicators, sampling rates and, mouse brain regions. The proposed approach: GDspike, is compared with other spike estimation methods including MLspike, Vogelstein de-convolution algorithm, and data-driven Spike Triggered Mixture (STM) model. The performance of GDSpike is superior to that of the Vogelstein algorithm and is comparable to that of the MLSpike. It can also be used to post-process the output of MLSpike, which further enhances the performance.},

    abstract={The paper extends ideas from subspace-based text-independent speaker recognition and proposes novel modifications for modeling multi-channel EEG data. The proposed techniques assume that biometric information is present in the entire EEG signal and accumulate statistics across time in a high dimensional space. These high dimensional statistics are then projected to a lower dimensional space where the biometric information is preserved. The lower dimensional embeddings obtained using the proposed approach are shown to be task-independent. The best subspace system identifies individuals with accuracies of 86.4% and 35.9% on datasets with 30 and 920 subjects, respectively, using just nine EEG channels. The paper also provides insights into the subspace model’s scalability to unseen tasks and individuals during training and the number of channels needed for subspace modeling.},

    abstract = {In contrast to the conventional input-output characterizations of neuronal responses to standard visual stimuli, here we asked whether six of the core visual areas have responses that are functionally distinct from each other for a given visual stimulus set, by applying machine learning techniques to distinguish the areas based on their activity patterns. Visual areas defined by retinotopic mapping were examined using supervised classifiers applied to responses elicited by a range of stimuli. Using two distinct datasets obtained using wide-field and two-photon imaging, we show that the area labels predicted by the classifiers were highly consistent with the labels obtained using retinotopy. Furthermore, the classifiers were able to model the boundaries of visual areas using resting state cortical responses obtained without any overt stimulus, in both datasets. With the wide-field dataset, clustering neuronal responses using a constrained semi-supervised classifier showed graceful degradation of accuracy. The results suggest that responses from visual cortical areas can be classified effectively using data-driven models. These responses likely reflect unique circuits within each area that give rise to activity with stronger intra-areal than inter-areal correlations, and their responses to controlled visual stimuli across trials drive higher areal classification accuracy than resting state responses.},
